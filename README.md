# Audio Basketball

aka Wave Basketball

My 6th Semester Computer Graphics project.

A simple game in C++ with OpenGL where we get to play music and toss a basketball around. At the same time!

You'll need the GL, GLU, glut, SOIL, openal and alut libraries to build. Install the required libraries and then run the build.sh file. That should be enough.

## Installing libraries:
OpenGL:	```sudo apt-get install freeglut3-dev```

SOIL: 	```sudo apt-get install libsoil-dev```

OpenAL: 	```sudo apt-get install libopenal-dev```

ALUT:   	```sudo apt-get install libalut-dev```

## More notes

Oh, and for now, it'll run only on UNIX systems. I'll work on getting it to work on Windows later.

All code is written entirely by me. The images are made on GIMP. I used a couple of images from here:

Music is by me as well. You can find more of my (rather poorly made) music on my Soundcloud: <https://soundcloud.com/the-dark-miko>
